# Uploads Notes and Assignments

### RND Uploads?

You might be wondering that why the name of this repository is "rnduploads"?

The answer is that I was going to make something for my research and development data. And I wanted to store everything in one place. That's why I named it "rnduploads".

Well that Idea just broke down because I leaked the repository before I could finish it and someone else gave me an idea that I should create something to upload notes and assignments. Then I just changed the goal but didn't change the name.

Moving on...
Well This project uses Node.js and Express.js as the server and MongoDB as the database and Azure Blob Storage as the storage.

I hosted the serverside code on Glitch.com and the database on An website that I don't know the name of.

This is the client side code. Server side code is in another repository named "rndbackend". 

Alright, that's it. I hope you enjoy this project.
See ya.
